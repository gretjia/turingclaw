# Audit Log - 2026-02-25

## What Was Done
- Continued kernel-focused hardening in `server/engine.ts`.
- Ran repeated independent audits via `codex exec` using `gpt-5.3-codex` with `model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"`.
- Added/updated guardrails for path validation, request preemption checks, HALT evidence gating behavior, and strict exec filtering.

## Validation
- `npm run lint` passed.
- `npx tsx tests/simulate_openclaw_v2.ts` passed.

## Independent Audit Status
- Latest independent verdict: `revise`.
- Current remaining concerns are mostly architecture/document consistency:
  1. README claims (`<200` core, zero third-party AI framework dependency) do not match current codebase shape.
  2. Core loop still carries mixed responsibilities relative to strict minimal-kernel philosophy.

## Recommended Unification Direction
- Split deterministic transition core from provider/mock/communication orchestration.
- Keep `server/engine.ts` strictly on register + delta semantics.
- Move adapters/providers to separate runtime modules.
- Align README and ENTRYPOINT with actual architecture invariants.
